                          Apart from the fact that I am a decadent, I am also the reverse of such a creature. Among other things my proof of this is, that I always
                          instinctively select the proper remedy when my spiritual or bodily health is low; whereas the decadent, as such,
                          invariably chooses those remedies which are bad for him. As a whole I was sound, but in certain details I was a decadent.
                          That energy with which I sentenced myself to absolute solitude, and to a severance from all those conditions in life to which I had grown accustomed;
                          my discipline of myself, and my refusal to allow myself to be pampered, to be tended hand and foot,
                          and to be doctored—all this betrays the absolute certainty of my instincts respecting what at that time was most needful to me.
                          I placed myself in my own hands, I restored myself to health: the first condition of success in such an undertaking, as every physiologist will admit,
                          is that at bottom a man should be sound. An intrinsically morbid nature cannot become healthy. On the other hand, to an intrinsically sound nature,
                          illness may even constitute a powerful stimulus to life, to a surplus of life.
                          It is in this light that I now regard the long period of illness that I endured: it seemed as if I had discovered life afresh,
                          my own self included. I tasted all good things and even trifles in a way in which it was not easy for others to taste them—out of my Will to Health
                          and to Life I made my philosophy.... For this should be thoroughly understood; it was during those years in which my vitality reached its lowest
                          point that I ceased from being a pessimist: the instinct of self-recovery forbade my holding to a philosophy of poverty and desperation.
                          Now, by what signs are Nature's lucky strokes recognised among men? They are recognised by the fact that any such lucky stroke gladdens our senses;
                          that he is carved from one integral block, which is hard, sweet, and fragrant as well. He enjoys that only which is good for him; his pleasure,
                          his desire, ceases when the limits of that which is good for him are overstepped. He divines remedies for injuries; he knows how to turn serious
                          accidents to his own advantage; that which does not kill him makes him stronger. He instinctively gathers his material from all he sees, hears,
                          and experiences. He is a selective principle; he rejects much. He is always in his own company, whether his intercourse be with books, with men,
                          or with natural scenery; he honours the things he chooses, the things he acknowledges, the things he trusts. He reacts slowly to all kinds of stimuli,
                          with that tardiness which long caution and deliberate pride have bred in him—he tests the approaching stimulus;
                          he would not dream of meeting it half-way. He believes neither in "ill-luck" nor "guilt"; he can digest himself and others;
                          he knows how to forget—he is strong enough to make everything turn to his own advantage.<br />
                          Lo then! I am the very reverse of a decadent, for he whom I have just described is none other than myself.

          <p>
              Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
              The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;
              But then begins a journey in my head,
              To work my mind, when body's work's expired:
              For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,
              Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
              And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
              Looking on darkness which the blind do see
              Save that my soul's imaginary sight
              Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
              Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,
              Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.
              Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
              For thee and for myself no quiet find.

              <h3>If You Forget Me</h3>
            <p class="font-italic">
                I want you to know
                one thing.

                You know how this is:
                if I look
                at the crystal moon, at the red branch
                of the slow autumn at my window,
                if I touch
                near the fire
                the impalpable ash
                or the wrinkled body of the log,
                everything carries me to you,
                as if everything that exists,
                aromas, light, metals,
                were little boats
                that sail
                toward those isles of yours that wait for me.

                Well, now,
                if little by little you stop loving me
                I shall stop loving you little by little.

                If suddenly
                you forget me
                do not look for me,
                for I shall already have forgotten you.

                If you think it long and mad,
                the wind of banners
                that passes through my life,
                and you decide
                to leave me at the shore
                of the heart where I have roots,
                remember
                that on that day,
                at that hour,
                I shall lift my arms
                and my roots will set off
                to seek another land.

                But
                if each day,
                each hour,
                you feel that you are destined for me
                with implacable sweetness,
                if each day a flower
                climbs up to your lips to seek me,
                ah my love, ah my own,
                in me all that fire is repeated,
                in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,
                my love feeds on your love, beloved,
                and as long as you live it will be in your arms
                without leaving mine.
